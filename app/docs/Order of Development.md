### 1. Project Setup and Basic Framework
- **Set up your project repository**: Initialize the project with necessary configurations, including build tools like Gradle or Maven.
- **Select and configure the web server**: Choose a lightweight web server (e.g., Jetty, Netty) and set it up for your project.
- **Establish a basic backend framework**: Create the foundational structure for your backend application, including core services and configurations.

### 2. Landing Page Development
- **Design the landing page UI**: Draft a simple yet intuitive design for the landing page that allows users to initiate a scan.
- **Implement landing page frontend**: Develop the frontend with HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript.
- **Backend for directory selection**: Create backend functionalities to handle user input for directory selection and start the scanning process.

### 3. WebSocket Setup for Real-Time Communication
- **Configure WebSocket in the backend**: Implement WebSocket support in your backend to enable real-time communication between the server and the client.
- **Integrate WebSocket on the frontend**: Establish a WebSocket connection on the landing page to receive real-time updates from the backend.

### 4. Basic Scanning Functionality and Real-Time Updates
- **Develop scanning service**: Create the service responsible for scanning directories and identifying duplicates based on size or a quick hash.
- **Implement real-time scanning updates**: Ensure that scanning progress and immediate results are communicated to the frontend via WebSocket.

### 5. Comparison Page and Detailed Analysis
- **Design the comparison page UI**: Outline the design for displaying detailed comparisons of duplicate files or directories.
- **Implement comparison page frontend**: Develop the frontend components required for presenting detailed duplicate information.
- **Backend support for detailed analysis**: Enhance backend services to provide comprehensive details for duplicates, including file paths, sizes, and potential content comparisons.

### 6. Full-Feature Scanning Mechanisms
- **Implement adaptive hashing**: Introduce advanced scanning capabilities, including adaptive hashing mechanisms that balance efficiency and accuracy.
- **Expand duplicate identification strategies**: Enhance the scanning service to include various methods for identifying duplicates, such as full hash comparisons.

### 7. Results Management and User Actions
- **User interaction for managing duplicates**: Develop frontend features that allow users to select and manage duplicate files directly from the web interface.
- **Backend support for file management**: Create backend functionalities to process user actions, such as deleting or preserving identified duplicates.

### 8. Additional Features and Enhancements
- **User settings and customization**: Implement a settings page where users can customize scanning parameters and other preferences.
- **Security and error handling**: Enhance the application with proper security measures and robust error handling mechanisms.

### 9. Testing, Optimization, and Deployment
- **Comprehensive testing**: Conduct thorough testing, including unit, integration, and UI tests, to ensure reliability and performance.
- **Performance optimization**: Analyze and optimize the application for performance, focusing on scanning speed and UI responsiveness.
- **Prepare for deployment**: Set up deployment processes, including any necessary CI/CD pipelines, and deploy the application for use.
