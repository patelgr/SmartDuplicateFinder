# Comprehensive Testing Strategy for Smart Duplicate Finder (SDF)

## Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Smart Duplicate Finder (SDF) tool, designed to ensure extensive coverage across various scenarios, including positive, negative, and edge cases. Our approach emphasizes:

- **Reusability:** Employing configuration-driven testing for easy addition or modification of tests without code changes.
- **Minimal code refactoring:** Using a modular test design with shared setup and teardown processes.
- **Dynamic test data generation:** Automatically generating test data based on configurations for efficient test execution.
- **Schema validation:** Ensuring test cases are well-formed and adhere to expected standards using JSON Schema.

## Test Environment Setup

### Requirements:

- Java JDK 17 or newer
- JUnit 5 for test execution
- YAML configuration files for defining test parameters and scenarios

### Setup Process:

1. **Dynamic Test Data Generation:** Utilize the `@BeforeAll` setup method to generate test directories and files based on configurations defined in `test-config.yml`.
2. **Schema Validation:** Leverage JSON Schema to validate the structure and contents of the YAML configuration files.
3. **Test Execution:** Execute tests using JUnit 5, taking advantage of parameterized tests to cover various scenarios specified in the YAML configuration files.

## Test Scenarios

### Positive Scenarios:

- **Unique Files Test:** Verifies the tool's ability to identify unique files accurately.
- **File-Level Duplicates Test:** Ensures the tool correctly identifies identical files in different directories.
- **Directory-Level Duplicates Test:** Confirms the tool's ability to recognize directories containing duplicate files.
- **Multi-Level Directory Duplicates Test:** Assesses the tool's capability to detect duplicates within nested directory structures.

### Negative Scenarios:

- **Invalid Paths Test:** Verifies the tool's response to non-existent or inaccessible directories.
- **Unsupported File Types Test:** Ensures the tool handles unsupported file types gracefully.
- **Read-Only Files/Directories Test:** Tests the tool's behavior with files or directories that have read-only permissions.

### Edge Cases:

- **Symbolic and Hard Links Test:** Evaluates the tool's handling of symbolic and hard links to avoid infinite loops and ensure accurate duplicate detection.
- **Special Characters Test:** Checks the tool's ability to process files and directories with special characters in their names.

## Reporting and Results

The tool categorizes findings into duplicates, uniques, and directories containing duplicates, providing a structured output for efficient issue resolution.

## Additional Considerations

- **Continuous Integration (CI) Testing:** Integrate the testing suite into CI pipelines to automatically run tests against every commit or pull request.
- **Dockerized Testing Environment:** Utilize Docker containers to ensure consistent testing environments across different machines and platforms (optional).
- **Performance and Stress Testing:** Conduct performance and stress tests to evaluate the tool's behavior under various loads and assess its scalability.

## Conclusion

This comprehensive testing strategy ensures the reliability and effectiveness of the SDF tool in detecting duplicates. By adopting a configuration-driven, schema-validated approach, we achieve a high level of test coverage and adaptability to new requirements, guaranteeing the long-term robustness of the SDF tool.
