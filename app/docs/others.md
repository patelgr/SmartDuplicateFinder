### Project Overview

#### Objective
To develop an interactive, web-based application that efficiently identifies and manages duplicate files and directories, enhancing usability and flexibility over the existing batch-oriented tool.

#### Target Users
Individuals and organizations looking to optimize storage by identifying and handling duplicate files and directories within their systems.

#### Core Features
- Interactive Web Interface: A user-friendly web interface for initiating scans, viewing results, and managing duplicates.
- Real-time Scanning and Updates: Dynamic scanning with real-time progress updates via a WebSocket connection.
- Adaptive Hashing: Utilizes both quick and thorough hashing mechanisms to balance speed and accuracy.
- Intelligent Aggregation: Reports duplicates at both the file and directory levels to minimize redundancy.

#### Value Proposition
SDF stands out by providing a real-time, interactive solution to duplicate management, moving beyond traditional batch processing tools and offering a more engaging user experience.

### Technical Requirements

#### Technology Stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (potential future use of Angular or React)
- Backend: Java, with a lightweight server (e.g., Jetty or Netty)
- WebSocket for real-time communication
- In-memory databases for quick data access, with options for persistence (e.g., H2, SQLite)

#### Architecture Overview
The application consists of a frontend web interface, a backend Java application, and a WebSocket for real-time communication. The backend handles scanning, data processing, and interacts with the database.

#### Security Considerations
Implement standard web security practices, including input validation, secure WebSocket connections, and secure handling of file paths and operations.

### Functional Requirements

#### User Interactions
Users can select directories for scanning through the web interface, view real-time progress, and interact with the results to manage duplicates.

#### System Features
- Directory and File Scanning: Allow users to select directories for scanning and display scan progress in real-time.
- Duplicate Identification: Implement multiple scanning strategies to identify duplicates by size, quick hash, and complete hash.
- Results Management: Enable users to view and manage duplicates directly through the web interface.

#### Performance Criteria
Optimized for performance, ensuring quick scans and real-time updates without significant delays or impact on system resources.

### Design Specifications

#### User Interface
The UI will include a landing page for initiating scans and a results page displaying duplicates in a tabular format, with options to manage them.

#### API Endpoints
Define RESTful API endpoints for starting scans, fetching scan results, and managing duplicates, ensuring clear documentation of inputs and outputs.

#### Data Models
Design data models to represent directories, files, scans, and duplicates, detailing attributes and relationships. Use in-memory structures for rapid access, with options for persistent storage.

### Development Strategy

#### Development Phases
1. Setup and Basic Functionality: Establish project structure, set up the web server, and implement basic scanning.
2. Real-Time Features: Integrate WebSocket for real-time updates and implement dynamic front-end updates.
3. Enhanced Functionality: Add advanced scanning options, duplicate management features, and persistent storage.
4. Testing and Optimization: Conduct comprehensive testing and optimize performance.
5. Deployment and Feedback: Deploy the application, gather user feedback, and implement improvements.

#### Testing Plan
Implement unit tests for backend logic, integration tests for API endpoints, and UI tests for frontend components. Consider automated testing tools and continuous integration setups.

#### Deployment Plan
Outline the process for deploying the web application, including any CI/CD pipelines, hosting platforms, and monitoring solutions.
